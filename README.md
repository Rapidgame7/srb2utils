# srb2utils
A script repository for SRB2.

---
# About
This repo contains an assortment of scripts, just like about any script repo lmao  
Many of these scripts were made by me, and about 2/3 of them were made thanks to the help from other users via incessant questioning at the SRB2 Discord server. `:)`

There are four main folders, prefixed by a number to maintain order:

Folder name|Description
:---:|---
Usable|Mostly complete scripts. May lack documentation or not be thoroughly tested, but should work out of the box.
Dev|Scripts I'm working on or are unstable. A fraction of them work as-is but could be improved through more features, a cleanup, or both.
Old|Scripts I no longer mantain or experiments I don't want to see again. Kept for archival.
Misc|Might potentially not be scripts lol :shrug:

While these scripts are mostly for use in SRB2, with some tweaking you might find some use out of them if you are working on a fixed-point based thing.

# Main attractions
dunno i think there's a vector/quaternion library somewhere. there's also a button state kind of thing, a remote sound player, a custom font drawer, and a massive library of small math utilities. oh, and half done fixed-point number interpolation. cool

# Warning
Many of my scripts lack documentation of any kind. You will find yourself asking "what does this do?" many times. I might add documentation to them *someday*, but not soon.

Welcome to the thunderdome.

# License
None. I prefer the honor system.  
If you are insane enough to borrow one of the scripts here, **I kindly request you credit me and anybody that has helped shape the script in some way.** Maybe even let me know you're using one of these so I know what gets the most attention and know what to fix?

Of course, you don't *have* to do any of that, but that makes you look like an ass.
