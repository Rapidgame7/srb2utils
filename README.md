# srb2utils
A mini utility library I made for SRB2 in one place so I can find them later

# Description 2
DOes nothing by itself.
Just a cullection of lumps with utility shit I made for me to reutilize later.
I generally don't want to rewrite things I've done in the past - Just improve them.
It's easier and cleaner sometimes I think lol

# Warning
About most of the scripts in this repo are incomplete or may have the chance to be written in a slightly more efficient and readable way.
You don't get to know which's which. Welcome to the thunderdome.
